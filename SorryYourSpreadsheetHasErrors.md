> How to Avoid Spreadsheet Errors ?

Like most programs, using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel is a manual process. That means your calculations are always susceptible to human error, such as keying in the wrong numbers or copying over the wrong amounts. Unfortunately, every formula is unique and has a specific task, there isn’t an automated tool to check for spreadsheet errors. Still, there are some steps you can take to prevent most errors from happening.

Some industries are proactively avoiding spreadsheet miscalculations by creating industry-wide standards of financial modeling. On a smaller level, organizations can skirt many major errors by developing an organization-wide, comprehensive policy for spreadsheet development. And, a good practice for any business is to include a final peer review or “scrub” of all spreadsheets before including them in analysis.

Many mistakes **can be spotted early** visually or through double-checking formulas. Has your organization put a process in place to avoid spreadsheet errors ?
