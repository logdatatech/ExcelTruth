# Excel in the Middle

Excel ends up in the Middle of an awfully long list of more expensive and more complicated software.

It also comes at it from empowering users over the Pure Text formats

- .CSV
- .TXT
- .XML

## Humble .CSV file

The universal lazy export for Reports. With the Open XML File format Server Side exports even on Linux should be in the newer .XLSX Formats now.

There are some issues with how Excel copes with .CSV files but it can be used for 95% or so examples.

## SAP

The Big Daddy of Numbers.

## Microsoft Project

Excel Sheets can be generated via VBA from MS Project that are automatically focussed in for a staff member.

## Microsoft Word

Taking Structured Data from Excel and generating Word artefacts is easy.

## Microsoft Visio

Visio loves being fed a Spreadsheet.

## Crystal Reports

A flashback for sure.
