## 1. Build great charts

Excel allows business users to unlock the potential of their data, by using formulas across a grid of cells. Data is inserted into individual cells in rows or columns, allowing it to be sorted and filtered, and then displayed in a visual presentation. Using pie charts, graphs and clustered columns adds meaning to data, which otherwise may just exist as row after row of numbers. These visualisations can add extra emphasis to business reports and persuasive marketing material.

## 2. Use conditional formatting

Excel users can format their spreadsheets using different colours, bolds and italics, to differentiate between columns and bring the most important data to the fore. The vast number of tasks that can be achieved using this tool is impressive, here are just a few: Display simple icons which represent related data, Highlighting a row based on a single value, Comparing values, Comparing lists and Finding duplicates. Find out more about conditional formating.

## 3. Help identify trends

When presenting data in the form of charts or graphs, it can be helpful to include average lines, which explicitly detail the key trends emerging from the information. This may help demonstrate the key points to other users in a straightforward manner - for instance, an executive from a different department during a board meeting. Excel allows trend lines to be extended beyond the graph, to offer predictions of future activity - and such forecasts can help businesses develop their future strategy.

## 4. Bring data together

Excel can be used to bring information from various files and documents together, so that it exists in a single location. As well as raw data and information from other spreadsheets, it is possible to import text and images. Other objects can be added using the Insert tab, or additional spreadsheets can be added to the file.

## 5. Excel Now Everywhere - Online access

Excel is available online as part of Microsoft's Office 365 productivity suite. This means business leaders and employees have access to the program from a range of devices, from almost any location. Providing they have a web-enabled PC, laptop, iOS, Android or tablet it should be possible to access Excel, making remote and mobile working viable

## 1. Business Analysis

The number 1 use of MS Excel in the workplace is to do business analysis.

Business analysis is essentially using collected data to inform decision making. Businesses naturally gather data in their day-to-day activities, which may be data on product sales, website traffic, spending on supplies, insurance claims, etc.

Business analysis is the activity of converting data into something useful to the people who run the business. For example, you could run a profitability report by the day of the week. If the business always loses money on a Sunday, then that’s information management could use to make a decision (such as closing on Sundays).

You may be surprised to learn that one of the top uses of Excel in business is to manage people.

MS Excel is a powerful way to organise information about people, whether they are employees, customers, supporters, or training attendees.

Using Excel, personal information can be stored and retrieved efficiently. A spreadsheet row or column can be used for an individual record that may include information like name, email address, employee start date, items purchased, subscription status, and last contact.

That means keeping track of supplier and client transactions, listing critical dates, and managing times and schedules.

While Amazon uses sophisticated custom software for operations management, MS Excel is an important tool for many smaller businesses (or parts of larger businesses). An advantage of Excel is that it’s relatively low tech, allowing it to be used by many people and without the risk of programming bugs.

A common way to convert data into a performance report in Excel is to create a pivot table.

Pivot tables have numerous in-built functions that allow for tasks such as counting and summing certain types of data within the dataset.

An advantage of using Excel is that you can easily share the project workbook to others, including to people who are unfamiliar with, or lack access to, custom PM software.
