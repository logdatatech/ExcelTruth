## Why 88% of spreadsheets have errors

## 14 BILLION POUND SPREADSHEET ERROR

Spreadsheet errors are costing businesses billions of pounds, according to a financial modeling company, which is calling for the introduction of industry-wide standards to reduce the risk of mistakes.

F1F9 estimated that 88 percent of all spreadsheets have errors in them, while 50 percent of spreadsheets used by large companies have material defects. The company said the mistakes are not just costly in terms of time and money - but also lead to damaged reputations, lost jobs and disrupted careers.

"What we need to do is take a look at how we use these spreadsheets. These spreadsheets underpin every critical business decision, and actually there are some real fundamental problems with the way spreadsheets are used," Kenny Whitelaw-Jones, managing director at F1F9, told CNBC on Tuesday.

A lack of industry-wide standards in financial modeling was the main cause of these mistakes, Whitelaw-Jones said. "If we can agree standards around how these models are put together, then it significantly reduces the risk of error," he said.
Some businesses were starting to harmonize their approaches to building these models, with the aim of reducing these types of errors, Whitelaw-Jones added. "But they are not eliminated – humans are still going to make errors. If the spreadsheet is ridiculously complex and impossible to read then nobody has a chance of actually reading it – and determining if there are any errors of it in the first place. That just becomes impossible."
In an eBook entitled "The Dirty Dozen", F1F9 outlines 12 of the most high-profile financial modeling errors, with Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's analysis into government debt-to-GDP ratios at number one.

The ranking also included the omission of a minus sign which cost Fidelity Magellan Fund around £1.6 billion ($2.45 billion) in 1995, and the British government's botched efforts to assess bids for the West Coast Rail Line in 2012, which is estimated to have cost around £50 million ($76.6 million)

"We think that's really just the tip of a much bigger iceberg – spreadsheets are used ubiquitously, and there are some real significant problems with the way they are used and that leads to real risk of error, and we're seeing that time and again," Whitelaw-Jones said.

His comments come as the administrators of an Irish insurance company accused PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) of "negligent auditing."

Michael McAteer and Paul McCann, from accountancy firm Grant Thornton, are suing the accounting firm for 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), but PwC said the proceedings were "unjustified and devoid of merit."

> The Limits of Spreadsheets

On January 16th, 2013, J.P. Morgan issued a report to shareholders titled “Report of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Management Task Force Regarding 2012 CIO Losses” (full citation in Appendix B) in which they investigate the loss of $6 billion in trades. They perform a detailed examination of the breakdown and describe the spreadsheet as a contributory factor. “During the review process, additional operational issues became apparent. For example, the model operated through a series of Excel spreadsheets, which had to be completed manually, by a process of copying and pasting data from one spreadsheet to another.” They uncovered a huge challenge with spreadsheets, which is the consistency and integrity of the computations made in the data. “Data were uploaded manually without sufficient quality control. Spreadsheet-based calculations were conducted with insufficient controls and frequent formula and code changes were made.” They continue on and label the Excel-based model as “error prone” and “not easily scalable.” As with any complex system, catastrophe requires multiple failures. We cannot point to their use of an “error-prone” spreadsheet as the primary cause, but certainly it appears to have contributed in the loss of $6 billion."

> Spreadsheet hell costs Tibco investors $100 million

TIBCO is the latest company to suffer the public indignity of falling into the trap of spreadsheet hell. It’s remarkably easy.

Chris Kanarcus pointed me to an embarrassing story about how an error  in a spreadsheet has led to Tibco investors losing $100 million when and if the planned acquisition by private equity bandits company Vista Equity Partners goes ahead. According to regulatory filings:
“In its Sept. 27, 2014, presentation to the Board of Directors, Goldman Sachs, using the spreadsheet, used a share count that overstated Tibco’s fully diluted common stock by the number of shares of restricted stock…”

This is being pitched as existing shareholders getting a ‘slightly lower’ payout to the tune of 61 cents a share but come on people – $100 million? That’s a tasty number in anyone’s book. It’s like me saying to Bill Gates: “Heh Bill, how about a check for 0.1% of your wealth?” That would still add up to $55 million but who gives a damn? He sure wouldn’t miss it. Would he?
More seriously, I’ve been saying it forever – like since at least 1997 – but it’s worth repeating:

Spreadsheets are general purpose tools that can do many powerful things but **they are a programming environment** and should be treated as such. That means testing and documenting according to good programming standards.

It is hardly surprising to learn that although beloved of many a CFO, spreadsheets are treated with an astonishing degree of abuse. There are conferences on spreadsheet management, Professor Ray Panko has been http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/My%20Publications/Whatknow.htm for many years. Now and again I hear of particular cases, often involving huge sums of money. Ones that immediately spring to mind include:Spreadsheet hell, an inconvenient truth
Heinekin overstating interest payments by more than $1.5 million per month in one financial reporting statement. Cause? Undocumented calculations.

Mortgage book overpayment on handover: $200 million. Cause? Logical error in calculating years outstanding.

PG&E reject NAPP bid but it included a single cell error that miscalculated demand generation requirements. Note – PG&E is no stranger to spreadsheet error. There are basic issues like failure to apply correct addition formula in documents going back to 2008.

Those with a taste for the morbid will enjoy this collection of clangers that include Kodak, Fannie Mae, Nevada City and many more.
Back to TIBCO. 

Reuters puts it well:

As in the spreadsheets of widely cited economist Thomas Piketty, however, even minor infelicities undermine credibility. With Goldman in line for a fee of nearly $50 million, Tibco surely expected exemplary attention to detail. Then again, shareholders might have thought Chief Executive Vivek Ranadivé and finance lieutenants would have the enterprise’s dollar value to hand in real time, and to have noticed when Goldman’s number was off in the fairly obvious second significant figure.

Tibco touts the ability of its products “to capture the right information at the right time.” The lesson of Goldman’s snafu for companies and financial advisers alike is to double-check, in spreadsheets and any other software, that’s what is really happening.

Maybe they should have used Tibco’s Spotfire? 

My take Many vendors have gone the path of least resistance, assuming that you can’t wean finance types off the ubiquitous spreadsheet. 

I call that lazy. Customers deserve better. Ring fencing the spreadsheet is a half way house solution.

The incidence of publicly reported failure remains low but studies consistently warn that upwards of 90% of spreadsheets likely contain material errors. The economic impact, while hidden, must be horrendous. Why do we put up with this kind of thing?

Dedicated analytical and reporting tools are far more accessible today then ever before. There really is no excuse for not considering modern solutions where the algorithms and calculation engines have been built with rigor in mind.

Almost every case study I have seen on the acquisition and use of analytical tools over close to 20 years cites the need to move off spreadsheets. Why do finance people cling onto them ?
