# Here are the most common spreadsheet mistakes that you’ve probably made before

My Father used to tell me a knife in the hand of a murderer leads to death but a knife in the hand of a surgeon leads to life. Excel is like that knife. Ok, ok this may be a far stretch (I hope) but in both instances the same tool can lead to different outcomes.

Spreadsheet design is part art and part science. It involves not only technical expertise but also attention to aesthetics.

There are two types of errors which can be made when working with spreadsheets: syntax and logical, to borrow nomenclature from the software development world. Syntax errors involve the disobeying of predetermined rules or structures. Those errors are typically picked up by Excel. For example mistyping a formula name or dividing by a zero automatically initiates a red flag.

## Mistakes in spreadsheet logic

Spreadsheets are notoriously strict with things like order of operations. If you don’t type your equations and formulas in properly,you will get the wrong math which can wreck an entire spreadsheet. Thankfully there is something you can do about that and it’s simply a matter of using more parenthesis. Put parts of your equations in them in order to get the desired effect.

## Misuse of built-in functions

A single wrong letter in a function can change its entire meaning. For instance, AVERAGE will ignore all text and false entries. AVERAGEA converts all text and false entries to zero. That one letter can totally change the outlook and values in your spreadsheet. Companies have misused functions and had wrong values in their spreadsheets for years and it caused damage of millions of dollars. If you’re using a function, then double check to make sure you’re using the right ones.

## Not copying all the cells you need

When you work with spreadsheets, there can be a lot of copying and pasting. It’s a very common problem that people don’t select all the cells they need to copy and paste into the next workbook. If you don’t, you’ll have missing information. That can cause a lot of problems if it isn’t caught. Since spreadsheets can get ridiculously big, this is actually harder than it sounds. If you have 15 years of financial history and you only copy ten years of it, you may not catch that right away.

## Keep your data entry and formula cells separate

Formula cells and data entry cells should never be anywhere near each other. The reason for this is relatively simple. If you put values in the formula cells that are supposed to be in the data entry cells and vice versa, then you can seriously mess up your books. When you keep them separate, you run little risk of mixing the two up and that keeps your books and your bosses happy.

## Save only when you need to

This one seems odd but it’s true. You should only save when you need to. This bit of advice flies right in the face of the oft-told advice to save frequently. Here’s why you should only save when necessary. Assuming you hadn’t made a mistake up to the point when you opened a saved spreadsheet, you went through the project with a spreadsheet without a mistake. If you make a mistake and save it for a bunch of times, then your mistake gets saved and you won’t be able to recover your flawless copy later. Thus you should only save when you know what you just did was correct.

## Create new spreadsheets if you want to experiment

If you want to play around with your spreadsheets, you should make a copy and alter that instead. You should never tinker with your main spreadsheets because you could lose your original copy in the event that you accidentally saved. To avoid what could be a cataclysmic mistake, do yourself a favor and keep copies.

## Give new cells a range name

Range names can help you keep things organized. You can sort by range name and it helps you find information more quickly. It only makes sense that if you create new cells that you should give them a range name. Not giving new cells a range name can limit how they’re sorted and searched which can make them hard to find. You’d be surprised how many people add new cells to a huge spreadsheet and don’t give them range names. It makes things cluttered and more difficult to work with.

## Delete range names when you delete all of its cells

You should also delete range names when you delete all of its cells and it’s for exactly the same reasons as number seven. When you make major changes to your spreadsheet, you need to update everything around the change in order to ensure proper documentation. Not doing so can cause others to re-enter information that was supposed to be deleted and can also hinder things like searching and sorting.

## Check your math

This seems like an obvious mistake but it’s absolutely essential. A company named Fidelity once had their books messed up by $2.6 billion over a silly minus sign. You can imagine what effect this had with investors and with the company’s higher ups. One tired night and you tap the minus sign on accident and you can make your company look like it has gained $1.3 billion more than it actually earned. Make sure you check even the most basic arithmetic you perform.

## Have someone double check your work

Most of the largest mistakes made in the world of spreadsheets came from people not double checking their work. This mistake is then transferred up the chain of command without anyone else seriously checking everyone else’s work, and it can result in horrible problems. If you work with spreadsheets, then you should find someone to check yours every now and again to make sure the numbers add up. If you’re in charge of people who work on spreadsheets, then you should double check their work more often. An article from 2013 posits that 88% of spreadsheets have an error in them. That’s not a promising number.

At the end of the day it comes down to just paying attention. When your eyes stare at tiny numbers in tiny blocks all day long, they’re bound to start missing things. Make sure you take a step away from the computer every now and then and give your eyes and your brain a break. Spreadsheets are great but they’re also very tedious and it’s very easy to make a mistake if you’re not paying attention.

The second type of errors are a bit harder to pinpoint; those are logical mistakes. These errors are more nuanced; they involve judgments, assumptions or simple oversights. The following is a list of logical errors to watch out for:

## Cell Reference

Far too often formulas and pivot tables are referencing the wrong range or only a portion of the needed data. That happens when data is moved or added without recalling the dependent formulas.

## “Elementary my dear Watson, elementary”

Sherlock Holmes stressed to his companion Watson the need to pay attention to the little things…the details. In elementary school we learned the order of operations for mathematical computations. That must be respected. To reiterate, that may seem elementary, but it is quite easy to design formulas that are completely incorrect. Use parentheses to protect and respect that order.

## Computation Components

That involves performing computations on data which do not agree. For example, attempting to attain total sales by multiplying two quantities rather than unit price and quantity. This will lead to the wrong totals.

## Hardcoded numbers

At times for one reason or another, formulas may be hardcoded with a value. However, if the document author is still under the impression that a formula is still located there, that can have some unintended consequences

## Disbursed variables\assumptions

That error is part aesthetic, part function. Centralizing all assumptions and variables aids in the proper digestion of a spreadsheet. Users of the spreadsheet do not have to hunt and peck throughout a workbook to input variables or discern assumptions. Make it simple for them, centralize it on one worksheet. Use space sparingly. A spreadsheet has 65,536 rows and 256 columns in versions older than 2007 and 1,048,576 rows and 16,383 columns for 2007. Just because all of these rows exist doesn’t mean they should be used. Centralize, place charts, summary tables, graphs and input variables in well positioned areas. The only exception to this rule is backup data which can take up as much space as needed. That helps in audits and review if information is centralized and fewer tabs are present.

## Readability

Simplify important content to be reviewed. Typically Executives and Managers do not have much time to decipher and review Excel spreadsheets. Make it easy for them, summarize relevant data when possible. Point them to the outcomes they are looking to analyze. Users typically focus more on information in the top left corner of a spreadsheet than permeating out. Place the most important information in this area.

> In programming they have the role "maintenance programmer" for someone that inherits code already written for a large program up to 10 maintenance programmers may touch the original work of 1 person.

## Hidden Sheets\Column

Hide sheets cautiously. Keep in mind the recipient of the document and its potential path. Sometimes hiding a worksheet is used as a security measure, a mechanism to conceal sensitive information. To put it bluntly, it is not a security measure. Not only can the user unhide those sheets unless protected, printing the entire workbook through the print menu will print those pages as well. A better solution would be to hardcode the dependent variables and remove the sheet before publishing. Special attention is needed when dealing with data related to salary and identification markers like social security numbers. Go the extra mile to protect this information.

## Lack of formula checks

Make sure there are formula checks for your spreadsheet. For example in accounting all journal entries must equal zero when totaled. Debits must equal credits. At times while manipulating a spreadsheet to reconcile differences the entry may become out of balance where debits no longer equal credits. That can be tracked by implementing a formula which sums the entries on the sheet to ensure that an entry does not fall out of balance.

## Complex formula

Simplicity still reigns. At times there may be an urge to cram everything into one formula. Resist that urge to create heavily nested lengthy formulas. Use named ranges and break up formulas to add clarity.

## Comment Sparingly

Whether it is comments within cells to alert users to important information or internal comments within the cell as a reminder to the developer, comment judiciously. I had a Professor years ago who said “If you label everything an emergency, then what you are really saying is nothing is important.” This holds true for comments. Over-commenting can actually send the wrong message to a user. It signals to the user that the comments as a collective do not deserve attention. This would be similar to highlighting an entire book when only a few lines or a paragraph needs attention.

## Intuitive

It is a kind of an overarching mistake. Always keep the user in mind by asking yourself what is simplest for him\her. Though I dislike breaking things down as gaps and overlaps always seem apparent, ask yourself Who? What? Where? and Why? Who is the document to be delivered to? (could be multiple) What needs to be displayed? Too much information is as much of a detractor as too little information. Where else might that document be delivered to? Many times documents may be forwarded to other parties including Senior Management and Trustees, keep this in mind and build it into your design.

## Duplication without inspection

Review a worksheet, formulas etc. before copies are made. If an error is apparent within one formula replicating it countless times only adds to your troubles. Having one problem is enough, don't compound it.

## Label charts or tables properly

Graphs, tables and data can be misunderstood and misinterpreted if labeled incorrectly. I was once told that many people only take a cursory look at graphs and tables in particular and omitting a label can leave the user to self interpretation.

## Lock Cells with formulas

In many instances it is worthwhile to lock important calculations or data to discourage manipulation, involuntary or otherwise. Even though passwords in Excel can potentially be broken, that roadblock or measure will save you some heartache later.

## Two pairs of eyes are better than one pair

It is along the lines of that old adage “Two heads are better than one”. Having a spreadsheet reviewed and critiqued by another party can yield a great benefit. It can assist in locating overlooked errors and lead to improved design. Also, the second individual acts as a “sanity check”, verifying that the spreadsheet is delivering its message clearly and error free.

## Aesthetics

The look and feel of a spreadsheet can add to the clarity of a report or detract from it. A spreadsheet that presents information in an unclear and stale fashion is doomed to be rendered useless. The majority of people would rather look at a graphical representation than a flood of numbers. Use that knowledge and try to roll up important information in a graphical format.

## Color – That point is along the lines of aesthetics

Colors carry meaning and invoke emotions. I am not suggesting spreadsheet authors take an interior design class or study hue theory, but use this knowledge of colors in your design. This is one of the reasons that negative numbers are represented in red and with brackets in the accounting world. This is to bring attention to the figure.

> In short, the message here is to simplify. Many times spreadsheets are designed without the user(s) or end recipient in mind. This is very much like an oral presentation; keep your audience in mind.

## Some More Errors

1. Always avoid hardcoding your values in the spreadsheet formulas. Only enter data into actual spreadsheet’s cells and then reference these cell values in your Excel formulas. By hard coding a value in a formula string it is not easy to spot nor pick up. What happens is that it is hidden and is forgotten. This invariably results in right this month and wrong forever.

2. Another very common error is adding rows or columns that are not pickup and included in the rage of the following functions =sum, =subtotal and =average.

3. Don’t mix data entry and formula areas together. Get into the practice of keeping them separate. This is an excellent discipline that pays dividends. This good practice is a big step in the process of eliminating spreadsheet errors.

4. Watch out for the division by ZERO and text values problem. Excel is not forgiving with design error.

5. Always save the changes that you are meant to save. Hit the save button as soon as you have complete the additions, changes or deletion. All it takes is one phone call that pulls you in another direction and you close your work-sheet to open another program and the work you did is lost. Follow the **Think – Save – Quit** logic when leave your spreadsheet workspace.

6. The opposite of point 5 also snags us. That is, opening up a spreadsheet to do a quick “what if” type query and saving the ad hoc investigation over the Excel worksheet we want to keep. To avoid this error it is best to open the Excel worksheet and immediately rename it as something else. My favorite is “Junk”.

7. Avoid circular references.

8. If you add rows or columns to the end of named ranges make sure that you include them in the range name.

9. When you delete range names or rows or columns containing these, always make sure that the names are not used in any macros or functions.

10. **Never hard code** cell or range addresses into VBA macros

11. If you work on someone else’s PC be aware that they may have their date settings different to yours.

12. If you have an imperfect memory like mine then get into the habit of documenting you VBA macros and difficult formulas (nested or other wise). In fact, even if you have a brilliant memory, document your VBA macros and worksheet formula.

Someone else will need to look at your work if you ...

* Get promoted
* Hit by a Bus
* Retire
* Win Lotto
* Get a Job Elsewhere
* Long Service Leave
* Maternity Leave
* Sick Day if it's important
