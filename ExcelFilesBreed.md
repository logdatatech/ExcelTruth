# How Many Excel Documents Do You Have

The permanent proliferation of Excel files in large organisations, and the pressure in the US from the Fed, has led to the development of major technological solutions like ClusterSeven to help us manage spreadsheets institutionally.

Some financial companies have a mind-blowing number of separate spreadsheets. Felienne Hermans, one of the world’s leading academic experts on institutional spreadsheet risk, tells the story of when she took her spreadsheet scanning software into a Dutch bank.

>“They confidently told me they thought they had about 10,000 spreadsheets,”

Hermans says.

> “I set the tool running and within an hour it had already found one million sheets. In the end they had 2.5 million spreadsheets, and this was a 1,500 employee company.”

Because spreadsheets are created by every analyst in an organisation, the associated business processes are being consciously or unconsciously designed to cope with the design constraints, technical limitations and operational risks of Excel.

These limitations are so fundamental to organisations that advanced Excel or modelling training is actually less about understanding how to use the advanced features of Excel, but rather to help analysts best cope with the constraints Excel imposes.

Many organisations will continue to beef up their policies but there’s a new view that the unique risks presented by spreadsheets/UDAs can’t be managed by traditional controls frameworks.

In response, operational risk teams are embracing financial model design standards like PwC’s 15 Model Design Best Practices and the FAST Standard (which PwC Australia is associated with) as a way to improve spreadsheets and lower spreadsheet risk.
